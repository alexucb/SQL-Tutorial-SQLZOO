1. Pick the code which shows the name of winner's names beginning with C and ending in n
SELECT name FROM nobel
 WHERE winner LIKE '%C%' AND winner LIKE '%n%'
SELECT name FROM nobel
 WHERE winner LIKE '%C' AND winner LIKE 'n%'
SELECT name FROM nobel
 WHERE winner LIKE 'C%' AND winner LIKE '%n'
SELECT winner FROM nobel
 WHERE winner LIKE '%C' AND winner LIKE 'n%'
SELECT winner FROM nobel
 WHERE winner LIKE 'C%' AND winner LIKE '%n'
2. Select the code that shows how many Chemistry awards were given between 1950 and 1960
SELECT COUNT(subject) FROM nobel
 WHERE subject = 'Chemistry'
   AND BETWEEN 1950 and 1960
SELECT COUNT(subject) FROM nobel
 WHERE subject = 'Chemistry'
   AND yr BETWEEN (1950, 1960)
SELECT COUNT(subject) FROM nobel
 WHERE subject = 'Chemistry'
   AND yr BETWEEN 1950 and 1960
SELECT subject FROM nobel
 WHERE subject = 'Chemistry'
   AND yr BETWEEN 1950 and 1960
SELECT subject FROM nobel
 WHERE subject = 'Chemistry'
   AND yr BETWEEN (1950, 1960)
3. Pick the code that shows the amount of years where no Medicine awards were given
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT yr) FROM nobel
 WHERE yr IN (SELECT DISTINCT yr FROM nobel WHERE subject <> 'Medicine')

 WHERE yr NOT IN (SELECT DISTINCT yr FROM nobel WHERE subject = 'Medicine')
SELECT DISTINCT yr FROM nobel
 WHERE yr NOT IN (SELECT DISTINCT yr FROM nobel WHERE subject LIKE 'Medicine')
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT yr) FROM nobel
 WHERE yr NOT IN (SELECT DISTINCT yr FROM nobel WHERE subject NOT LIKE 'Medicine')
SELECT COUNT(yr) FROM nobel
 WHERE yr NOT IN (SELECT DISTINCT yr FROM nobel WHERE subject = 'Medicine')

                 WHERE subject IN ('Chemistry','Physics'))
SELECT yr FROM nobel
 WHERE yr NOT IN(SELECT subject
                 FROM nobel
                WHERE subject IN ('Chemistry','Physics'))
SELECT yr FROM subject
 WHERE yr NOT IN (SELECT yr
                    FROM nobel
                   WHERE subject IN ('Chemistry','Physics'))
6. Select the code which shows the years when a Medicine award was given but no Peace or Literature award was
SELECT DISTINCT yr
  FROM nobel
 WHERE subject='Medicine' AND
       subject NOT IN(SELECT yr from nobel
                      WHERE subject='Literature')
